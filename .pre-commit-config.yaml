# Reference: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit
# We can rewrite default `pre-commit` by git to python pre-commit by follow this step:
#   (1) pre-commit uninstall & pre-commit install
#   (2) cd .git/hooks & rm pre-commit
#   (3) pre-commit install & pre-commit run --all-files
# NOTE: see https://pre-commit.com/hooks.html for more hooks
